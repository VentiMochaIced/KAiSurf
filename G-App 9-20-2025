The latest file/s are the oly active working examples from GEMINI Pro 2.5 Ai CANVAS output generation, from simple create Python Browser Chat line inquiry, surprizing results were found, immedaite Log in accesss to YouTube (also app version) and better Audio flow than standard Chrome (latest/I can not explain why, so its just part of the exploration...thank you for your attention to this relative point in the next update.)

Add on will remain missing from incomplete source code developed recently, as an AgenticAiAssistant Chat relay, node to node, sample from secondary prompt will 'upload' upon request, so I can prove concept, that the 'project' exists, while it is actively attempting to promote an alternative to Chrome paid or not GEMINI assistant model/extention?, really worked/s and such as a potentially better 'assistant' than Chrome offers, without PY Add On support of course...IDK..lol~

I am researching the best steps to promote the 'PROJECT' as it references my level of DEV input here, only to output samples of Ai Asisted journey to final version/s, or accessing best WEB/model combination...current user access terms of 'For Educational Purposes only.' will be applied to ALL DOCS, on any level, from me by 'supplying' GNU as user feedback to communal experimentation, on a non-budget, or taken from REPO to replace itself with a new License (ALL REQS met), or equivilent on 'DB' satifying new 'media' alternative goals of my future AIA coding strategy for higher learning via KAISURF.
