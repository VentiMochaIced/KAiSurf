Koralai/KAiSurf v2.0+ "KinetiK Kontent" - Module Enhancement Plan
1. Core Vision & Design Goal
This document outlines the development roadmap for evolving the Koralai/KAiSurf suite from a private browsing tool into a collaborative online platform. The central goal is to create "KinetiK Kontent": live, shared "surfing environments" where users interact with curated web content in real-time.
The business model will leverage the existing affiliate system to drive adoption of premium collaborative features, with user engagement incentivized through a rewards system ("Kones").
2. Phase 1: The Cloud Foundation (App Version 1.1)
This phase focuses on connecting the local browser to the cloud backend, laying the groundwork for social features with a minimal-storage approach.
Module: Cloud Profile & Settings UI
Description: A new, persistent UI element at the top of the Koralai Browser to manage the user's online identity and sharing preferences.
Frontend Requirements (Koralai Browser):
Implement a new toolbar or panel to display the user's login status (verified via the backend API).
Create a settings modal accessible from this UI for managing profile data (email, affiliate code).
Develop "Content Relay" settings, allowing users to define rules for what content is shared and with whom.
Backend Requirements (KAiSurf Server):
Create new API endpoints (GET /user/profile, POST /user/profile) to manage lightweight user data.
Module: Basic Content Relay
Description: The initial implementation of sharing a URL to a cloud-based "environment." This will conform to the "minimal content return" goal, storing only metadata.
Frontend Requirements (Koralai Browser):
The browser's "bookmark" function will be updated. When logged in, it will send the URL and basic metadata (title, user notes) to the backend.
Backend Requirements (KAiSurf Server):
The backend will receive and store this data as lightweight JSON within the user's profile or a related table. This avoids heavy database schemas initially (meeting the non-db storage met v1.0.1 criteria).
3. Phase 2: Collaboration & Monetization (App Version 2.0)
This is a major upgrade requiring significant backend changes (db upgrade version 3.+). It introduces the core social and rewards features.
Module: Live Communications Addon ("Multi-connect")
Description: A real-time chat and communication layer within each shared environment, forming the core of the collaborative experience.
Frontend Requirements (Koralai Browser):
Integrate a WebSocket client to establish a persistent connection with the server.
Develop a chat UI panel that displays messages and user activity within the active environment.
Backend Requirements (KAiSurf Server):
Implement a WebSocket server to manage real-time connections and message broadcasting.
Requires a major DB schema upgrade to include tables for chat messages, channels/environments, and user permissions.
Module: "Kones" Rewards System
Description: An in-app currency and rewards system to incentivize user interaction and affiliate-driven growth.
Frontend Requirements (Koralai Browser):
Add a UI element in the Cloud Profile to display the user's "Kones" balance.
Backend Requirements (KAiSurf Server):
Requires a DB schema upgrade to add a user wallet or ledger table for tracking "Kones."
Develop the business logic for awarding/transacting "Kones" based on defined activities (e.g., content sharing, affiliate sign-ups, daily logins).
Module: Upvote & Interaction System
Description: A secondary, lightweight social feedback mechanism to gauge content value within an environment.
Frontend Requirements (Koralai Browser):
Add an "upvote" (tick) button next to each URL shared in an environment.
Backend Requirements (KAiSurf Server):
Add a new database table to track user interactions (likes/upvotes) per content item.
4. Phase 3: Future Vision (App Version 3.0+)
This phase explores the long-term, conceptual goals of the platform, positioning it for future technological trends.
Module: "Koralcity" Metaverse Integration
Description: The conceptual framework for a geo-graphical, 3D metaverse experience built around shared "KinetiK Kontent."
Requirements (Primarily Backend/API):
Define a standardized API data structure for exporting "environments" (URLs, notes, chat logs) to a 3D rendering engine.
Research and develop prototypes using WebGL/Three.js or APIs for existing metaverse platforms.
Investigate geo-broadcasting to allow users to discover public content environments based on physical location, creating a "digital twin" of shared knowledge.
